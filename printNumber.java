public class printNumber {

    public static void main(String[] args){

        int num = 100;
       for( int i = 1; i <=num; i++){

/*Solution



1. Instance variable is a variable declared inside the class of the variable but outsidy the body of a method
For example:
public class instance{
float = 0.5f //instance variable
static  int n = 3// static variable

public static void main(String[]args){
double k = 5// local variable

}

}
 Another name for Instance variable is non-static field

2. Static field is a variable that is held in common for all instance of a class . It also called called class variable
3. The primitive data type supported by Java are
	boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.*/
